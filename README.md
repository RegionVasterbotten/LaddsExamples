# LaddsExamples
This notebook gives some examples on how to access (open) data from a CKAN-instance. It also shows some examples of basic tinkering with the data and finally gives an example on a basic visualization.

The idea is to give you some examples that can be used and hopefully lower the barrier for creating value from (Open) Data and initiating discussion of what data that should be published as Open Data.

It is early stages and anyone who wants to give me new examples or a revised version of the published example(s) are welcome to do so. You can mail me at thomas.kvist@regionvasterbotten. Comments and tips regarding examples, the lab environment ar also welcome to do so.

Unfortunately, I will not be able to provide much support if you run into CKAN, Python or Jupyter related trouble.

Important note: Individual notebooks is not backuped right now. To be sure that your notebooks is preserved, please copy your personal Jupyter notebook to your own computer/storage unit to prevent irreversible loss if the lab environment breaks down.
